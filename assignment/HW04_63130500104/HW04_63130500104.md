## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)

# Dataset
books <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")
```

This dataset holds a list of 270 books in the field of computer science and programming related topics.
The list of books was constructed using many popular websites which provide information on book ratings an of all the book in those websites the 270 
most popular were selected.



## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `fct_lump()` from package [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/articles/forcats.html)). It using for collapsing the least/most frequent values of a factor into “other”.
- Function `fct_infreq()` from package [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/articles/forcats.html)). It using for reordering a factor by the frequency of values.

```
books %>% mutate(Type = fct_lump(Type,n=4))
ggplot(aes(x = fct_infreq(Type),y = n)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) The bar chart represents the number of books of each type.
```
book_price_plot <- books %>% mutate(Type = fct_lump(Type,n=4)) %>% count(Type,sort = T)

#GGplot2
book_price_plot <- book_price_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = fct_infreq(Type),y = n)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="#f68060", alpha=.6, width=.4) +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw()

book_price_plot + ggtitle("Price Average of Type Book") + xlab("Type") + ylab("Price average")
```
Result:

![Graph 1](plot1.png)


### 2.) The chart shows the ratings of each book type.
```
book_rt_plot <- books %>% mutate(Type = fct_lump(Type,n=5)) %>%  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))
#GGplot2
book_rt_plot <- book_rt_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = Type,y = mean)) + geom_point(aes(color=Type)) 

book_rt_plot + ggtitle("Rating Average of Type Book") +
  xlab("Type") + ylab("Rating average")
```
Result:

![Graph 2](plot2.png)
