Choose Dataset:
1. Top 270 Computer Science / Programing Books (Data from Thomas Konstantin, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaskonstantin/top-270-rated-computer-science-programing-books)) >> [Using CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv)

### Outlines
1. Explore the dataset
2. Learning function from Tidyverse
3. Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data
4. Visualization with GGplot2

## Part 1: Explore the dataset

```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library("ggplot2")
library(forcats)

#Load data
books <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")
view(books)
```


This dataset is all about books with ratings, review scores, prices, and details about each book.



## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `fct_lump()` from package [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/articles/forcats.html)). used to set the number of rows want to show.

```
books %>% mutate(Type = fct_lump(Type,n=3)) %>% count(Type, sort = TRUE)
```
** You can sepearate this part or combine in part of `Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data`

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) The bar chart represents the Number Of Pages average of Type Book.
```
Page_plot <- books %>% mutate(Type = fct_lump(Type,n=5)) %>%  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(Number_Of_Pages = mean(Number_Of_Pages, na.rm = TRUE))

Page_plot <- Page_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = fct_infreq(Type),y = Number_Of_Pages,fill=Type)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") 

Page_plot + ggtitle("Number Of Pages average of Type Book") + xlab("Type") + ylab("Number Of Pages average")
```
Result:

![Graph 1](plot1.png)


### 2.) Book price charts go up and down about ratings and reviews.

```
bookPrice_plot <- books %>% select(Book_title,Price,Reviews,Rating) %>% filter(Reviews > mean(Reviews, na.rm = TRUE))

bookPrice_plot <- bookPrice_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = Rating,y = Reviews,color=Price)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

bookPrice_plot + ggtitle("Book price charts go up and down about ratings and reviews.") +
  xlab("Rating") + ylab("Reviews")
```
